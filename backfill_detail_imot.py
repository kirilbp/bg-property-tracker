"""
Fills in description for imot.bg listings that scraper_imot.py's grid
crawl never visits the detail page for.

imot.bg's own search-result cards carry no free-text description at all
(only price/area/sqm/floor) - the real description sits on each listing's
own detail page, in a <div class="moreInfo"> prefixed with the fixed
label "Описание на имота:". Confirmed live via probe_descriptions.py
(a Playwright fetch - imot.bg blocks plain requests-based fetching, same
Cloudflare/Akamai-style check scraper_imot.py's own grid crawl already
works around).

This script is a new, separate, resumable pass - imot.bg's grid crawl has
never visited individual detail pages at all (unlike alo.bg/bazar.bg,
which used to do this inline before their own nationwide conversions and
already had a decoupled backfill to reuse) - visiting each listing's own
page (scraper_imot.py's fetch_listing_detail(), reusing the same
goto_with_retries() the grid crawl already uses) for whatever hasn't been
checked yet, prioritized newest-first (by first_seen) so freshly
discovered listings get a real description before older ones queue behind
them - same pattern backfill_detail_alo.py/backfill_detail_bazar.py/
backfill_detail_bcpea.py already established.

A listing is marked "detail_checked" once its detail page has actually
been visited, regardless of whether that page turned up a real
description - without an explicit marker those would get needlessly
re-visited by every future run instead of being treated as done.

Scheduled hourly (see backfill-detail-imot.yml) - a fresh full backlog
(~21,700 listings) clears over about two days at this run's cap, after
which each run only has to keep up with that day's newly-discovered
listings, a much smaller number.
