# Working in this repo (kirilbp/bg-property-tracker)

Read this before touching GitHub Actions or the shared working directory - both have caused real, user-visible problems this session.

## Never iterate by repeatedly dispatching a live GitHub Actions workflow

Every failed `workflow_dispatch` run sends the repo owner a failure email. A "dispatch it, watch it fail, patch one line, dispatch again" debugging loop is genuinely disruptive to them even when each individual run is harmless - this happened for real (5 failed runs of one diagnostic script in ~35 minutes, all from iterating live instead of validating first) and the owner had to tell us directly to stop.

Before any live dispatch of a new or changed script:
- Read it end to end for the failure modes you can already see. The specific bugs that caused real failures this session were all things a careful read would have caught: an unhandled HTTP error with no response body logged (so the first failure taught nothing), a slow aggregate query (`count=exact`) with no statement-timeout fallback, a column referenced that doesn't exist in production yet.
- Dry-run or syntax-check whatever you can locally first.
- Get it right before it touches production Actions - one live dispatch that works beats five that iterate you there.

If a live dispatch still fails despite that care, fix the *specific* confirmed cause from its actual logs before dispatching again - don't treat redispatch itself as a debugging step.

This applies to every agent working here, not just one role - general-purpose builders have caused this as often as named agents.

## This working directory is shared with other concurrently-running agents

More than one agent session can be operating in `/home/user/bg-property-tracker` (or wherever this repo is checked out) at the same time, each able to see the others' in-progress, uncommitted changes. Before committing or discarding anything:
- Run `git status`/`git log --oneline -5` first. If you see uncommitted changes you didn't make, leave them alone unless they're clearly unrelated and you're only committing your own specific files.
- For anything beyond a trivial docs edit, prefer building in an isolated `git worktree` off `origin/main` (or the relevant branch) rather than working directly in the shared checkout - this has already prevented real collisions this session.
- Never `git add -A` in a shared checkout.

## Nothing ships without Missy's review

Every code change - however small, however confident you are - goes through Missy's review before merging, per each agent's own standing rules. Self-merging is a real mistake that's happened this session (caught and corrected each time, but avoid it in the first place).
