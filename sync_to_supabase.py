Computes the same cross-portal-deduped view index.html's groupListings()
computes client-side (ported 1:1 from index.html: same CYR_TO_LAT
transliteration table, same normalizeArea/areasMatch/pricesMatch rules, same
two-pass no-bridging-through-sqm-less-listings union-find, same
BCPEA_TYPE_LOOKUP/BG_CITIES type-bucket and city-key logic - verified against
the real algorithm in index.html, not reimplemented from scratch), and
upserts it into Supabase (listing_sources + merged_listings) so the frontend
can query just what it needs server-side instead of shipping every
scraper's whole JSON file to the browser on every page load.

A merged listing's id is a deterministic hash of its sorted member
(portal, source_id) pairs - NOT "whichever source currently scores highest"
(today's in-browser approach), which drifts day to day as days_on_market
changes and silently breaks bookmarked #/listing/<id> links. A group's id
only changes when its actual membership changes.

Reads the 8 already-committed data/leads_*.json files - the scrapers
themselves are unchanged, JSON stays the source of truth and safety net.
This script only writes to Supabase.

Auth: SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY must be set as environment
variables (GitHub Actions repo secrets in production). The secret key
bypasses Row Level Security entirely (see supabase/schema.sql, which has no
write policies at all), so it must never reach the browser or be written to
disk/committed - only ever passed in via the environment.

# Live-investigated (docs/backlog.md item 4, task 4): a real cluster of
# olx.bg listings near Близнаци (Varna's own coastline, e.g. lat/lng
# 43.1032247/27.9233784 - a genuine, live-scraped in-Bulgaria coordinate)
# came back unresolved from the strict point-in-ring test above even
# though they're plainly inside Varna oblast. Traced to the actual edge
# geometry, not a logic bug in _point_in_ring (that algorithm - standard
# ray-casting - was verified correct against the raw ring data): the
# nearest ring edge crossing at this point's own latitude sits at
# lng=27.923306, and the listing's own lng is 27.9233784 - about 8 meters
# further east, outside Varna's own simplified coastline polygon by less
# than the width of a single building. This is coastline-simplification +
# ordinary GPS/geocoding precision noise, not a wrong-oblast bug - the
# yurukov/Bulgaria-geocoding boundary data this project already uses (see
# OBLAST_BOUNDARIES' own comment above) is intentionally simplified for
# file size, and a beachfront-adjacent point is exactly where that
# simplification bites hardest. NEAR_BOUNDARY_TOLERANCE_DEG below adds a
# small, deliberately conservative fallback for this specific shape of
# miss - a point that's just barely OUTSIDE exactly one oblast's own
# boundary, not a name-matching gap and not a substitute for the strict
# test above (still tried first, unconditionally).
#
# ~0.003 degrees is roughly 200-330m in Bulgaria's own latitude range
# (parallels/meridians aren't equal-length in degrees - ~111km/degree
# latitude, ~78-85km/degree longitude across Bulgaria's 41-44N range) -
# comfortably past this real incident's ~8m gap and ordinary consumer-GPS/
# geocoder error, while still far too small to bridge the gap between two
# genuinely different oblasts anywhere they share a real inland border
# (every BG_OBLASTS pair's own shared-border segments are tens of km long,
# not meters) - and even then, only fires when exactly one oblast is
# within tolerance; two oblasts both within tolerance (a real shared
# border) is left unresolved rather than guessed, same "don't guess an
# ambiguous case" discipline as BG_MUNICIPALITY_TO_OBLAST's own "Бяла"
# exclusion.

# (item 4 task 4), but the opposite failure shape - there, a real point
# fell just OUTSIDE the correct oblast's simplified polygon and came back
# unresolved; here, a handful of alo.bg listings' real, accurately-
# geocoded coordinates (e.g. 42.8445, 27.882196 - confirmed against the
# listing's own title text, "...директен достъп до плажа Обзор, област
# Бургас") fall just INSIDE Varna oblast's own simplified polygon by the

# below (which only runs when the strict test finds nothing) never even

# ordinary coastline-simplification/GPS noise range, and both the

# administrative division - "Бяла" is deliberately NOT included here even
# though it's common in the data: it's a real, different municipality in
# BOTH Varna and Ruse oblasts, genuinely ambiguous from the name alone,

# municipality (Столична община) - Банкя/Нови Искър/Панчарево/Кремиковци/
# Бистрица/Лозен/Владая/Желява and others - maps to "sofia_grad", not

# BG_MUNICIPALITY_TO_OBLAST above is municipality-*seat*-only (265 names) -
# structural, not a "just missing a few" gap: most of Bulgaria's ~5,300 real
# settlements sit in a municipality whose SEAT has a different name, so
# they're invisible to it even though their own municipality unambiguously
# determines an oblast (docs/backlog.md item 4, task 2 - live-sampled:
# 1,545 distinct real settlement names unmatched, e.g. Типченица,
# Изворово, Илинденци, Цалапица).
#
# data/bg_settlements_to_oblast.json is the real fix: derived from
# yurukov/Bulgaria-geocoding's settlements.csv + municipalities.csv (the
# SAME maintained public dataset this module already uses for
# OBLAST_BOUNDARIES above - not a new, unvetted source) via
# settlement -> municipality code -> oblast, cross-validated against every
# name already in BG_MUNICIPALITY_TO_OBLAST above (27 of the resulting 28
# municipality-code prefixes derived with ZERO contradictions against this
# table's own hand-verified entries; the 28th, "SOF" = Столична, Sofia-
# grad's own single municipality, is unambiguous by construction - Sofia-
# grad has exactly one). 4,513 distinct settlement names found in the raw
# data; of those, 521 (~11.5%) appear under more than one oblast anywhere
# in Bulgaria and are EXCLUDED from the generated file entirely - same
# "don't guess an ambiguous name" discipline as this table's own "Бяла"
# exclusion above, just applied programmatically instead of by hand. That
# automated rule independently rediscovered "Бяла" (spans 3 oblasts in the
# full settlement-level data, not just the 2 known from municipality
# seats) and "Средец" (spans 3 oblasts on its own, before even accounting
# for the separate Sofia-grad-district collision Missy flagged) with no
# special-casing needed - a good sign the rule is doing the right thing
# generally, not just on the two cases already known about. The 3,784
# names left (well past the 1,545 actually observed missing, so real
# margin) are purely ADDITIVE: any name already decided by hand above
# (checked first in oblast_key_from_municipality() below, unchanged) is
# never overridden by this generated file, even on the rare case both
# would have agreed anyway.
#
# Regeneration: re-run the derivation described above against a fresh
# settlements.csv/municipalities.csv if Bulgaria's own municipality map
# ever changes (rare - the last real changes were years ago) or if a
# future audit finds more names needing the ambiguous-exclusion treatment
# by hand (add them to _MANUALLY_EXCLUDED_SETTLEMENTS below rather than

# entry for the full evidence). A general "trust area text over city_key
# whenever they disagree and area resolves via BG_MUNICIPALITY_TO_OBLAST"
# fix was tried and rejected after checking it against real committed
# data: it produces MORE false positives than it fixes. imot.bg's own URLs
# prove several other (city, area) disagreements are a real in-city quarter
# coincidentally sharing a name with a distant municipality seat, not a
# misfiling - e.g. "...grad-vratsa-samuil" (35 currently-ungeocoded
# listings would have flipped Враца->Самуил's real municipality-seat
# oblast, Разград) and "...grad-sliven-novo-selo" (30 listings; Ново село
# is Vidin's municipality seat name, but this is Sliven's own quarter) -
# these two examples alone account for 65 of the 166 total (city, area)
# disagreements the general rule would have touched across the dataset.
# So this is a
# single, exact, evidence-confirmed (city, area) pair override, not a
# general rule - only extend it with the same two-sided confirmation
# (real coordinates AND a portal's own URL text agreeing) demonstrated
# here, never by table membership alone.
#
# 2026-09-23 (Placy investigation into a real undercount report): widened
# from imot.bg-only, exact-raw-string matching to any portal, matched by
# normalize_area() instead of a literal string - live-confirmed the SAME
# "Ловеч"+Червен-бряг pair recurs on imoti.net (own URL:
# ".../lovech/lovech-cherven-brjag/...", city="Ловеч", area="Cherven Bryag"
# in Latin script - normalize_area() maps it to the same "cherven bryag"
# key the Cyrillic imot.bg/imoti.bg records already use) and on imoti.bg
# itself (city="Ловеч", area="Червен бряг") - both missed by the old
# imot.bg-only gate. This isn't the general rule rejected above: it's the

# raising any exception - it just returns 0 or near-0 listings for that
# portal, and nothing upstream of this file (the scraper's own exit code,
# the git commit step) can tell that apart from a genuinely quiet run.
# Without this guard, delete_stale_merged_listings()/delete_stale_listing_
# sources() below would read "not in what I just loaded from disk" as
# "genuinely gone" and delete it from the live tables in this same sync -
# for a portal the size of alo.bg (83,939 listings at the time this guard
# was added), that's an unrecoverable, one-run deletion of real, live data
# over what was actually just a broken scrape. Comparing this run's count
# against what's already live catches that before any DELETE fires: stale
# data sitting in the live tables one cycle longer than necessary is
# always the safer failure than deleting real, current listings a scraper
# just failed to see.
