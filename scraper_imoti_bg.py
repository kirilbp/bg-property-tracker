"""
Scrapes current for-sale listings from imoti.bg, nationwide, across all 6
property categories (flat/house/land/garage/shop/business) - the first
scraper converted for the nationwide expansion (see category_classifier.py
and the Supabase migration this builds on). Picked as the first portal to
convert because it's the smallest today (71 Sofia listings vs. thousands
on every other portal), so any pagination/field-extraction mistakes here
are cheap to find and fix before applying the same approach to the much
larger portals.

imoti.bg's homepage location filter is a select2 widget wrapping a hidden
native <select>, with the actual URL built client-side on search-button
click - there's no separate API call to intercept. But the resulting
filtered URL turned out to be stateless/bookmarkable, confirmed live via
plain requests with no need to repeat the dropdown-click simulation.
Removing the location filter entirely (di:софия) gives the nationwide,
all-cities URL; the old Sofia-only scraper was already scoping down to
apartments only after the fact (APARTMENT_SLUGS) even though the search
itself already mixed every property type - so going nationwide-and-
all-categories only means removing two filters that were already just
being discarded downstream, not a new capability the site lacks.

Each listing's permalink URL embeds both its property-type slug (e.g.
"тристаен-апартамент", "къща", "парцел", "гараж") and its city slug
(e.g. "софия", "пловдив", "варна") - LISTING_LINK_RE now captures both
generically instead of the old Sofia-only, apartment-only enum, since
every city and category shares the same URL shape on this site.

Each listing card is the smallest ancestor whose text mentions the price
("<amount> EUR") exactly once, same "climb from the link" approach as the
other portals' scrapers. A page fetch retries a few times with backoff
before being treated as the end of pagination, so a transient failure
doesn't get mistaken for having reached the last page.

Nationwide expansion also requires fields the Sofia-only card-only scrape
never captured: a full description and a real listing-posted date, both
only available on each listing's own detail page - fetch_listing_detail()
adds one extra request per listing for these (same pattern already used
by scraper_alo.py for site_updated_at/coordinates). This is the first
portal to pay that cost nationwide; whether the same approach scales to
the much larger portals (imoti.net, alo.bg, bazar.bg - tens of thousands
of listings each) is exactly what the staged rollout is meant to surface
before committing to it there.

fetch_listing_detail() (extended 2026-09-24) also pulls spec fields (sqm/
property type/features, incl. has_elevator/furnished/has_central_heating
derived from those features) and agency contact info (name + real
external website, never a phone number) out of the SAME application/
ld+json block its description extraction already successfully parses -
see its own docstring and geo_utils.extract_specs_imoti_bg()/
extract_contact_imoti_bg() for exactly which schema.org fields are read
and why. construction type/built year/completion status/floor number/
floor qualifier are deliberately NOT extracted: no core schema.org
vocabulary covers them, so there's no real evidence of where (or
whether) they'd live in this site's own ld+json - see
extract_specs_imoti_bg()'s own comment for what a future contributor
with live access should check first. No new photo or coordinate
extraction was added alongside these: this page embeds only one photo
total (already captured as "photo", see fetch_listing_detail()'s own
docstring) and carries no coordinates of its own anywhere (every listing
is already geocoded from area/city text at grid-crawl time below) - both
confirmed dead ends, not gaps this change left open.

imoti.bg genuinely carries no coordinates anywhere in its own pages
(confirmed by a real headless browser finding no map DOM node/object/
iframe, and a plain static fetch finding nothing either), so each
listing's area name is geocoded via OpenStreetMap Nominatim instead
(geo_utils.Geocoder), cached by query string.

fetch_listings_page() originally called Geocoder.geocode() directly - a
live, blocking Nominatim request on every cache miss. That was fine
Sofia-only (a few hundred distinct neighborhood names, one-time cost),
but a real nationwide production run (started before this fix existed)
took over 4 hours instead of its usual ~35 minutes - nationwide means far
more distinct city/area combinations, so most calls were live round-trips
rather than cache hits, the identical failure mode later confirmed and
fixed the same way for scraper_homes.py's own nationwide rewrite (see
its module docstring for the full story). Fixed the same way here:
fetch_listings_page() now does a cache-only lookup
(Geocoder.geocode_cached_only - no network call); backfill_geocode_imoti_bg.py
+ its workflow do the live, rate-limited lookups as a separate, resumable
pass. The "city" field is now persisted alongside "area" specifically so
that backfill script can rebuild the exact same query string later
without needing to re-derive it from the page HTML.

    size variants of the same image, both under /assets/offers/) - a
    genuine per-portal limitation, same as imoti.net's missing description
    (see backfill_detail_imoti_net.py's docstring). The single photo it
    does have is already captured below as "photo".

    Also does not add any new coordinate source: fetch_listings_page()

# Fields fetch_listing_detail() supplies on top of what the grid crawl
# (fetch_listings_page()) itself produces. Unlike the other portals'
# scrapers, fetch_listings() here calls fetch_listing_detail() inline for
# EVERY listing on EVERY run (not a separate, one-time backfill pass) -
# but per its own docstring it's best-effort and "never raises... a
# missing field shouldn't drop a listing", so a single transient per-run
# failure (timeout, a missing meta tag/ld+json block that day, a page
# render hiccup) legitimately returns (None, None, None, None) for a
# listing that had real detail-page fields on a previous run. update_history()
# must merge these in from the previous "latest" rather than let a fresh
# record's None wipe an already-captured value - docs/backlog.md item 9a
# (originally fixed in six other scrapers, this one was missed since it
# has the identical bug but wasn't part of that investigation's "all six
# scrapers with this function" premise).
#
# specs/contact fields (added 2026-09-24, same reasoning scraper_alo.py's
# own equivalent list already documents for its identically-shaped merge):
# property_type_raw/features/has_elevator/furnished/has_central_heating/
# agency_name/agency_website are all detail-only (the grid crawl never
# produces them) and best-effort (not every listing's ld+json carries
# every field), so they get the same merge-not-replace protection
# description/site_posted_at already have.
#
# "sqm" IS also listed here, matching what scraper_alo.py's own
# _DETAIL_ONLY_FIELDS actually does (not the opposite - a previous version
# of this comment wrongly claimed alo.bg excludes it). sqm is normally a
# GRID field (SQM_RE, set directly from card text), which is why it isn't
# detail-only in the sense the fields above are - a fresh grid crawl that
# DOES find real sqm text must still be able to overwrite an old value
# (real edits happen). But now that fetch_listing_detail() can ALSO fill
# sqm in (via extract_specs_imoti_bg()'s floorSize, for whatever fraction
# of listings whose card never showed "... кв.м" text), the same
# merge-not-replace protection every other detail-only field gets is
# needed here too - otherwise a later grid-only re-touch that (per this
# function's own docstring above) hits a transient detail-fetch failure
# and again finds no sqm text on the card would silently wipe a real sqm
# value a previous run's detail fetch had already filled in - exactly the
# bug class this field list exists to prevent, and exactly the scenario
# this module's own fetch_listing_detail() docstring describes ("a single
# transient per-run failure... legitimately returns None... for a listing
# that had real detail-page fields on a previous run"). Being in this list
# still means "prefer the fresh value when the fresh value is non-empty"
# (see update_history() below) - so a genuine grid-parsed sqm change still
# wins; this only stops a grid MISS from clobbering a real detail-page
# value.
