"""
Ongoing relisting detector: some sellers "reduce" a property's price not by
editing the existing ad but by deleting it and posting a brand new listing
(new portal ID, often at a lower price) - invisible to per-ID price
tracking since, from the scraper's point of view, it's just one listing
disappearing and an unrelated one appearing. This chains those pairs back
together using a signal that's already in our own data and needs no
network access: several portals host each listing's photos at a URL that
embeds a stable per-image identifier, which stays the same when a seller
reuses their existing photos on a new post even though the listing ID
changes.

Validated directly against real data before building this: bazar.bg's
photo URLs embed a stable Focus-backend image ID
(imotstatic*.focus.bg/.../<id>_<size>.jpg) - a real pair was found this
way, bazar_55673363 (delisted) -> bazar_55775706 (a new listing that
appeared the next day using the literal same photo file). imot.bg shares
the same Focus backend. homes.bg and imoti.bg host photos under a unique
per-image filename too. imoti.net's photo path embeds the CURRENT
listing's own ID (self-referential - a relisting would get a new path
regardless of whether it's the same photo file, so URL matching can't
work there) and alo.bg's stored "photo" field turned out to often be the
listing agent's avatar image, not a property photo, shared across many
unrelated listings from the same agent - both excluded here since URL
matching against either would produce false positives. Real photo-hash
comparison could extend coverage to those two later, but that needs to
download and compare actual image bytes, which needs network access this
runs without.

For each portal it supports: finds listings that stopped appearing in
scrapes (were removed) and a different, currently-active listing on the
same portal that started appearing afterward using the identical photo
file. Injects the removed listing's final known price as a real
historical snapshot on the new listing, tagged "source": "relisted_from"
with the old listing's ID for provenance - never fabricated, always the
old listing's own last real observed price at its own last real observed
time. Safe to run after every scrape: already-recorded pairs are skipped
on subsequent runs.
