"""
Scrapes current listings from OLX.bg, nationwide.

OLX.bg blocks plain requests-based fetching (an Akamai-style edge check
returns a 403 before any content), but a real headless browser gets through
cleanly - confirmed via Playwright/Chromium against the live site. Each
listing card is the smallest ancestor whose text mentions the price
("<amount> €") exactly once, same "climb from the link" approach as
scraper.py, scraper_alo.py, and scraper_imot.py. Within that card the text
follows one of two layouts depending on whether the listing is in a city
or a village (confirmed live across Plovdiv/Varna/Burgas oblasts):
    line 0: title (free text)
    line 1: "<price> €"
    line 2 (city listing): "гр. <City>, <area> - Обновено на <date>"
    line 2 (village listing): "с. <Village> - Обновено на <date>"
      (villages have no separate sub-area - the settlement itself is both
      the city and the area)
    line 3: "<sqm> кв.м - <price per sqm>"

Unlike imot.bg/imoti.net (no single "nationwide" URL exists at all), OLX.bg
does have one: dropping the region path segment entirely
(/nedvizhimi-imoti/prodazhbi/, no oblast-<slug> suffix) returns real,
distinct listings - but it turned out to hit the SAME real per-query depth
cap (~page 26-27, ~1,000-1,400 listings) as any single oblast-scoped query,
live-verified against Sofia and Plovdiv independently in the same browser
session. So the bare nationwide URL alone can't carry full national
coverage; oblast-level slicing (OBLAST_SLUGS below, each a live-verified
/nedvizhimi-imoti/prodazhbi/oblast-<slug>/ URL) is used instead, the same
pattern imot.bg needed at city granularity. 26 of Bulgaria's 28
administrative oblasts resolved to a real olx.bg oblast page (Targovishte
and Sofia-oblast/Sofia-province - distinct from Sofia-city, which IS
covered - didn't resolve to a guessed slug and are skipped).

Because oblast slicing is coarser than a real city (an oblast query returns
listings from every settlement in it, not just its namesake city), each
listing's city/area is parsed from its own card text rather than trusted
from the query - same reasoning as alo.bg's LOCATION_RE, just with the
extra city-vs-village branch above.

Search results are paginated with ?page=N (confirmed via the site's own
paginator). A page navigation retries a few times with backoff before
being treated as the end of pagination, so a transient failure doesn't get
mistaken for having reached the last page - and, since scrape.yml runs
several scrapers sequentially with a single git commit step at the end, an
uncaught exception here would otherwise silently discard every other
scraper's output for that run too. Past the real depth cap boundary, the
site still renders a page with exactly one stray listing link (not zero) -
confirmed live - so pagination stops on <=1 real links, not only on 0.

Line 2's "Обновено на <date>" (confirmed live format: "20 август 2026 г.")
or bare "Днес"/"Вчера" reflects when the listing was actually last updated
on OLX, and is parsed into a real date so days_on_market/motivation score
are computed from that instead of purely from when we first scraped the
listing - otherwise a listing that's actually been up for months shows as
"0 days on market" just because we only just started tracking it.

olx.bg carries no coordinates anywhere on its own pages, but every
listing's real settlement/neighborhood name is genuinely geocodable -
resolved here via OpenStreetMap Nominatim (geo_utils.Geocoder). At
nationwide scale, doing that live and inline during the scrape doesn't fit
in a single run (the same problem scraper_homes.py hit first - see its
module docstring), so this only does a cache-only lookup and leaves the
rest for backfill_geocode_olx.py to fill in as a separate, decoupled pass.
This portal's search also isn't apartments-only (it's "all real estate for
sale"), so each listing's category (apartment/house/land/commercial) is
classified from its title too, for the frontend's same-category
radius-average feature.
