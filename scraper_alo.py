"""
Scrapes current Bulgaria-wide apartment listings from alo.bg.

Search results are paginated with &page=N. The scraper originally only
fetched page 1 with no pagination loop at all - fixed by paging through
page=2, page=3, ... until a page comes back with no listings, same "stop
on empty page" pattern as scraper_bazar.py, scraper_imot.py, and
scraper_imoti_bg.py, capped at MAX_PAGES as a safety limit. Learned from
scraper.py's imoti.net fix: a delay between requests is needed to avoid
getting rate-limited (HTTP 403) partway through, and a failed request is
treated as "no more listings" (stop and keep what was collected) rather
than crashing the whole run.

Found in production (not in earlier live testing) that a single request can
also fail transiently - e.g. a connect timeout with no HTTP response at all,
unrelated to any real block - and treating that identically to "no more
listings" cut a real run off at page 21 of ~166, keeping only 613 of the
old Sofia-only ~9995 listings. A page fetch retries a few times with
backoff first, but at nationwide scale (2,800 pages instead of 166) even a
low per-page failure rate means SOME page exhausting all retries becomes
likely over a full run, not a rare fluke - confirmed live as the real
cause of alo.bg's chronic nationwide undercount (~15,000 tracked against
this scraper's own ~80,424-listing live-verified total): fetch_listings()
still couldn't tell "this one page failed after retries" (a transient
blip - the crawl should skip it and keep going) apart from "a real empty
page" (genuinely reached the end - the crawl should stop), so the first
page anywhere in a 2,800-page run to exhaust its retries silently ended
the entire crawl right there. Now tracked separately: a page that
exhausts retries is skipped (losing only that one page's ~60 listings,
not the rest of the run) and only enough CONSECUTIVE page-level failures
in a row (suggesting a real, sustained outage rather than one-off
flakiness) actually stops the crawl early.

Nationwide conversion: the Sofia scope was two URL params, ?region_id=22
&location_ids=4342 - live-verified that dropping them entirely (or setting
region_id=0, same effect) gives nationwide results, jumping the site's own
stated total from ~10,009 to ~80,424 (apartments only; this scraper still
doesn't cover other property types, same as before). Paged all the way to
~2600 with real content and no block of any kind (unlike homes.bg/
imoti.net's confirmed depth caps) before hitting a genuine 404 past the
real last page - alo.bg's own per-page listing count is also higher
nationwide (60/page vs 30/page Sofia-only), so the real total is closer to
~156,000. MAX_PAGES raised well past that with real margin.

LOCATION_RE replaces the old Sofia-only AREA_RE (which matched "<area
words>, София" specifically) - live samples of real non-Sofia cards found
the consistent shape "<settlement>, [област ]<city>" immediately before
"Цена :" (note: alo.bg's "област" - region - is a PREFIX before the city/
region name here, unlike imoti.bg's own listings elsewhere in this project
where it's a trailing suffix - these are two different portals' own text
conventions, not the same rule). Captures settlement as "area" (unchanged
meaning) and the city/region name (with any "област " prefix stripped) as
a new "city" field, matching what index.html's/sync_to_supabase.py's
city-key logic already expects.

days_on_market/coords/category: previously fetched inline during the main
scrape by visiting every listing's own page (the search grid carries no
date signal at all). At nationwide scale (~156,000 listings vs. the old
~10,000 Sofia-only) that's no longer affordable in a single scrape pass,
so it's decoupled the same way homes.bg's/imoti.bg's geocoding was:
fetch_listings() now only does the fast grid crawl, and
backfill_detail_alo.py (a separate, resumable, prioritized-by-newest-first
job) visits listing pages over time to fill in site_updated_at/lat,lng/
description/specs/contact via fetch_update_dates() (kept here, now unused
by the main scrape path but still imported and reused by the backfill
script).

description is extracted via geo_utils.extract_description_alo() - as of
backlog #9 (2026-09-23) this deliberately returned None unconditionally
rather than `.obqva-block` text, which turned out to be a title echo, not
a real free-text description (see the NOTE above that function in
geo_utils.py for the full investigation). As of 2026-09-24, that function
has a real implementation, built from real user-supplied screenshots of a
live detail page rather than a live HTML probe (this sandbox's network
egress to alo.bg is still blocked) - see its own comment for the full
selector strategy. The same screenshots are also the source for two new
detail-page extractors wired in below: geo_utils.extract_specs_alo()
(property type/size/construction type/built year/completion status/
floor/features from the page's structured spec table - sqm from here
feeds the existing sqm/price_per_sqm fields, which were null for
essentially every alo.bg listing before this) and geo_utils.
extract_contact_alo() (agency name + real external agency website -
deliberately NOT the masked phone number; see that function's own comment
for why no phone extraction is implemented).

# Fields fetch_update_dates() (run separately via backfill_detail_alo.py -
# main() never calls it inline, see fetch_listings()'s own comment) adds
# on top of what the grid crawl (fetch_listings_page()) itself produces -
# never present on a fresh grid-only record. update_history() below must
# merge these in from the previous "latest" rather than let a fresh grid
# re-touch wipe them off an already-detail-checked, still-active listing
# every ~6 hours - docs/backlog.md item 9a. Same field list
# merge_history_conflict.py's own module docstring already names for this
# exact gap.
#
# "sqm" is a special case added 2026-09-24: it's normally a GRID field
# (fetch_listings_page()'s own SQM_RE sets it directly when a card happens
# to show "Квадратура: ..." text), which is why it isn't detail-only in
# the sense the other fields below are - a fresh grid crawl that DOES find
# a real sqm value must still be able to overwrite an old one (real edits
# happen). But now that fetch_update_dates() can ALSO fill sqm in (via
# extract_specs_alo(), for the ~99% of listings whose card never showed
# it), the same merge-not-replace protection every other detail-only field
# already gets is needed here too - otherwise a later grid-only re-touch
# that (as usual) finds no "Квадратура:" text on the card would silently
# wipe a real sqm value this backfill had already filled in, the exact
# shape of bug this field list exists to prevent. Being in this list still
# means "prefer the fresh value when the fresh value is non-empty" (see
# update_history() below) - so a genuine grid-parsed sqm change still
# wins, this only stops a grid MISS from clobbering a real detail-page
# value.
