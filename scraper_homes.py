"""
Scrapes current Bulgaria-wide apartment, house, and land listings from
homes.bg.

Unlike imoti.net and alo.bg, homes.bg's homepage embeds a structured JSON
blob (window.__PRELOADED_STATE__) with the listing data already parsed out
by their own frontend - no HTML/regex scraping needed, just pull the JSON.

Nationwide + all-categories mechanism (found via live diagnostic probing,
since neither is documented or guessable from the URL alone):
  - City filter: the homepage defaults to Sofia-only. Adding
    ?locationId=0 drops the location filter entirely (confirmed live:
    offersCount jumped from 12,351 Sofia-only to 44,111 nationwide, first
    result a non-Sofia city) - this is the one nationwide switch, used on
    every request below.
  - Property type: a plain ?type=<anything> query param is silently
    ignored - every guess (URL slugs, short codes, full business names)
    fell back to the same Sofia-dropped-but-still-apartment-only result.
    The real mechanism, found by reading homes.bg's own client JS bundle
    (static/js/client.*.js), is ?typeId=<PascalCase business name> - e.g.
    ?typeId=HouseSell. homes.bg has only 4 real for-sale property types
    total (no office/shop/garage/warehouse exist on this portal at all,
    unlike imoti.bg): ApartmentSell, HouseSell, LandParcel (regular land
    plots) and LandAgro (agricultural land) - confirmed nationwide counts
    44,111 / 9,625 / 13,406 / 2,115 respectively. TYPE_QUERIES below
    drives one full paginated pass per type.

Because the category comes straight from which portal search category
the listing was fetched under (ground truth from homes.bg's own search
index), not inferred from title/description text, category_confidence is
always "high" here - this is more reliable than the keyword-based
classifier used for portals that don't expose a real per-listing type.

The pagination loop stops on the API's own hasMoreItems=False; MAX_PAGES
is just a generous safety cap in case that flag ever misbehaves.

A page fetch retries a few times with backoff before being treated as the
end of pagination, so a transient failure doesn't get mistaken for having
reached the last page - and, since scrape.yml runs all scrapers
sequentially with a single git commit step at the end, an uncaught
exception here would otherwise silently discard every other scraper's
output for that run too.

Each offer's raw JSON also carries a "photos" array (not just the single
cover "photo") - captured and surfaced on the listing detail page. It also
has a key literally named "description", which despite the name is NOT a
free-text listing description - confirmed via a full raw-offer dump
(probe_deeper_history.py, Actions run 32700254970, 2026-08-24) and by
sampling data/leads_homes.json live (backlog #9): it's consistently a
short construction-material/furnishing tag line (e.g. "Тухла/Бетон,
Полуобзаведен" - "Brick/Concrete, Semi-furnished"), never prose, and this
JSON blob has no other field holding real description text. Surfacing it
as "description" actively misled users, so parse_offer() below leaves
that field unset rather than populated with the wrong content - see its
own comment for what a real fix would require.

There's also a "time" field, initially assumed
to be a real "last updated" signal (like olx.bg's, see scraper_olx.py) -
but sampling 280 live offers found 100% of them reporting "днес" (today)
with zero variation, meaning homes.bg apparently marks every actively
displayed listing as "today" regardless of true listing age. Using it
for days_on_market would make every homes.bg listing permanently show 0
days, which is worse than not using it at all - it would mask exactly
the stagnant, long-listed properties this tool exists to surface. So
days_on_market here stays purely tracking-based (time since we first
scraped the listing), same as before.

homes.bg carries no coordinates anywhere on its own pages, but every
offer's "location" string (neighborhood/settlement + city/region) is
genuinely geocodable via OpenStreetMap Nominatim (geo_utils.Geocoder).
Sofia-only scraping could afford a live geocode call per cache miss
in-line (a few hundred distinct neighborhood names total, one-time
cost) - nationwide, that assumption breaks: a bounded 1-page-per-type
trial run (~80 listings, almost all cache misses against the old
Sofia-only cache) took over 10 minutes and was still running when
cancelled, even after cutting Nominatim's request timeout from 15s to
8s. Blocking the actual scrape on live geocoding at nationwide scale
risks either starving it of runtime or hammering Nominatim's free,
rate-limited public endpoint well past what a single sequential 1
req/sec caller can clear in one run. So fetch_listings() now only does
a cache-only lookup (Geocoder.geocode_cached_only - no network call,
returns None on a miss) - existing cached areas (mostly Sofia, from
prior runs) resolve for free, everything new starts as lat=lng=None and
gets filled in over time by backfill_geocode_homes.py, a separate
workflow_dispatch job that does the live, rate-limited Nominatim calls
without competing with the scrape for time or blocking it on network
flakiness. extract_area() used to split specifically on ", София"
(Sofia-only scraping never needed anything else); now that every city
in Bulgaria shows up here, it generically splits on the last comma
instead, keeping the more specific neighborhood/settlement part as
"area" - the geocode query itself (built the same way here and in the
backfill script) uses the full location string rather than assuming a
Sofia suffix.

Pagination depth cap and the price-band slicing fix: a real nationwide
run found every type's pagination stopping at exactly page 49
(~980-1,000 results) regardless of the much larger offersCount each type
reports - a site-side depth cap, not a natural end of results (confirmed:
even a single narrow-enough slice paginates cleanly past where the cap
would otherwise bite, to a real partial last page with hasMoreItems=
False). Live diagnostics (probe_homes_slicing.py, kept for reference)
found priceFrom/priceTo are real, working filter params, and that the
real nationwide price distribution is heavily skewed - flat price bands
aren't fine-grained enough in the dense middle of the market, so
bisect_price_slices() recursively narrows each type's [0, 1,000,000)
price range, splitting any slice whose own offersCount is still over a
900-result safety margin (SLICE_THRESHOLD, comfortably under the ~1,000
cap), until every leaf slice is safely paginable to its true end;
everything above 1,000,000 (confirmed consistently small - 108-573
listings per type - across live checks) is scraped as one final tail
slice. This full scheme was verified live before being wired in here:
236 count-only requests found the real retrievable total across all 4
types is ~70,253 listings, versus the ~3,900 the old flat per-type loop
actually retrieved.
