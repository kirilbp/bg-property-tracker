Scrapes current listings from imot.bg, nationwide.

imot.bg blocks plain requests-based fetching (a Cloudflare/Akamai-style bot
check returns a JS challenge page instead of real content), but a real
headless browser gets through cleanly - confirmed via Playwright/Chromium
against the live site. Each listing card is the smallest ancestor whose
text mentions the price ("<amount> €") exactly once, same "climb from the
link" approach as scraper.py and scraper_alo.py. Within that card the text
follows a consistent per-line layout, confirmed identical across Sofia,
Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas:
    line 0: title (e.g. "Продава 2-СТАЕН")
    line 1: "град <City>, <area>" (city listing) or "с. <Village>" (village
      listing - the village itself is both city and area, same convention
      olx.bg's own VILLAGE_LINE_RE uses; not independently live-sampled
      here the way the "град" shape was, since only actual cities were
      queryable before this module's own oblast-level crawl below - see
      that section's own comment)
    line 2: "<price> €"
    line 3: "<sqm> кв.м, <floor/description/phone...>"

Unlike homes.bg/alo.bg (a single URL switch drops the location filter for
a genuine nationwide result) or imoti.net (city segments requiring their
own English-spelled slug), imot.bg has no single "all of Bulgaria" URL at
all AND its own per-query pagination hits a real depth cap around page
27-28 (~1,080 listings at 40/page) regardless of scope - live-verified:
Sofia, Plovdiv, and even the bare /obiavi/prodazhbi URL (no city segment)
all cap at the same boundary independently. Extensive live probing (a
price-filter form turned out to be 82 hidden POST fields with no usable
GET param, and no district/kvartal URL segment exists either - see git
history for the full diagnostic trail) found no way to sub-slice a single
over-cap city further. City-only slicing (CITY_SLUGS below, each a
live-verified /obiavi/prodazhbi/grad-<slug> URL) was the first coverage
this module shipped: every city fits comfortably under the cap except
Sofia itself (confirmed 1000+ listings by the site's own UI), which is
accepted as still capped at ~1,080 rather than fully complete - a known,
documented limitation, not a bug. 24 of 29 canonical BG_CITIES resolved to
a real imot.bg city page; the other 5 (smaller towns - Asenovgrad,
Kazanlak, Dimitrovgrad, Dupnitsa, Svishtov) don't appear to have their own
page and are skipped.

docs/backlog.md item 31: CITY_SLUGS' 24 cities, however it's sliced, can
only ever cover a fixed, manually-curated set of towns - Bulgaria's ~230
other towns and ~5,000 villages were structurally never queried at all
(100% of every captured listing's own `city` field was confirmed to be one
of the 24 allowlisted names, zero exceptions). OBLAST_SLUGS below adds
real oblast (province)-level coverage on top - imot.bg does support this:
confirmed via web-search-indexed real imot.bg URLs (this sandbox's own
network egress to imot.bg is fully blocked, so unlike the CITY_SLUGS
verification above this could not be a direct Playwright/browser fetch;
every slug below was independently confirmed real by finding actual,
distinctly-titled imot.bg pages indexed for it - e.g. "Имоти в с. Велчево,
област Ловеч за продажба | Imot.bg" at
/obiavi/prodazhbi/oblast-lovech/s-velchevo - not guessed from a naming
pattern) - same URL shape as CITY_SLUGS
(/obiavi/prodazhbi/oblast-<slug>), reusing the identical oblast slug
spelling scraper_olx.py's own OBLAST_SLUGS already uses for 26 of 27
entries (imot.bg's own oblast pages are independently real, not copied
blind - each was confirmed to exist above; they just turn out to use the
same slug spelling olx.bg does for every oblast both portals cover). Two
confirmed differences from olx.bg's OBLAST_SLUGS, both content, not
copying error:
  - Sofia's slug is "sofiya", not olx.bg's "oblast-sofiya-grad" - imot.bg
    does not split Sofia city from Sofia Province into two separate oblast
    pages the way olx.bg (and Bulgaria's real 28-oblast administrative
    split) does. Confirmed live: /obiavi/prodazhbi/oblast-sofiya/gr-sofiya
    (Sofia city) AND /obiavi/prodazhbi/oblast-sofiya/gr-botevgrad,
    .../s-gradets (real Sofia Province towns/villages) are indexed under
    the SAME "oblast-sofiya" URL. One consequence: this single combined
    query shares imot.bg's ~1,080-listing depth cap across both Sofia city
    AND every Sofia Province town/village, so - unlike every other
    oblast - it cannot be trusted to carry full Sofia city coverage on its
    own; CITY_SLUGS' own dedicated "grad-sofiya" query (which already
    accepts being capped at ~1,080 for Sofia city alone, see above) is
    kept running in the city-level phase specifically so Sofia city
    coverage doesn't get diluted by the rest of Sofia Province sharing the
    same combined oblast query's cap.
  - Търговище/Targovishte is included - confirmed real on imot.bg
    (/obiavi/prodazhbi/oblast-targovishte, real listings indexed) even
    though scraper_olx.py's own docstring notes this oblast didn't resolve
    to a real page on olx.bg and is skipped there.
  27 oblast pages, covering all 28 of Bulgaria's real administrative
  oblasts (since imot.bg's single combined "oblast-sofiya" page already
  covers the same Sofia-city + Sofia-Province territory olx.bg needs two
  separate oblast pages for) - genuinely complete territorial coverage,
  not a curated subset like CITY_SLUGS.

Because an oblast query is coarser than a real city (it returns listings
from every settlement in the oblast, not just one queried city), each
listing's city AND area are now parsed from its own card text (see the
per-line layout above) rather than trusted from which CITY_SLUGS/
OBLAST_SLUGS entry produced it - same reasoning, and largely the same
regex shape, as olx.bg's own CITY_AREA_LINE_RE/VILLAGE_LINE_RE. This
replaces the old "tag city from the query slug" mechanism entirely
(including for CITY_SLUGS' own city-level queries, not just the new
oblast ones) rather than keeping two different tagging mechanisms
side by side. One known, deliberately NOT "fixed here" consequence:
docs/decisions.md's 2026-09-23 location-allocation entry found imot.bg's
own site groups Cherven Bryag (a real Pleven-oblast town) under a
"grad-lovech"/"oblast-lovech" URL and municipality claim
("...obshtina-lovech") that is factually wrong (Cherven Bryag is its own
separate municipality in Pleven oblast) - that wrong claim is imot.bg's
own site data, not a scraper misread, so if imot.bg's own rendered card
text for that listing also spells its city as "Ловеч" (not confirmed
either way - this sandbox has no live access to that specific card),
parsing straight from card text would faithfully reproduce imot.bg's own
error rather than silently paper over it, exactly as it should: a scraper
that returns what the source site actually says, not what the scraper
guesses the site "should" say. `sync_to_supabase.py`'s portal-agnostic
`CITY_AREA_OBLAST_OVERRIDE` (docs/decisions.md, same entry) already exists
specifically to correct this exact (city, area) pair downstream, past
scraper output - out of this module's own scope.

A page navigation retries a few times with backoff, and if all retries for
one page are exhausted, that page is skipped (not treated as the end of
the query's pagination) - only MAX_CONSECUTIVE_PAGE_FAILURES in a row
gives up on that city/oblast. Without this, one bad request mid-crawl
would silently truncate every remaining page for that query, identically
to the bug found in scraper.py/scraper_alo.py. Separately, since scrape.yml
runs several scrapers sequentially with a single git commit step at the
end, an uncaught exception here would otherwise silently discard every
other scraper's output for that run too.

docs/backlog.md item 31 (after item 30's fix on scraper_olx.py):
CITY_SLUGS' 24-city phase runs first, unbounded by design - it has
reliably finished well within the workflow's own 60-minute timeout on
every one of 6 consecutive recent runs even before OBLAST_SLUGS existed,
so it keeps that shape rather than gaining rotation machinery it doesn't
need (a deadline check is still present as a pure defensive safety net).
OBLAST_SLUGS' 27-oblast phase runs second and DOES reuse
scraper_olx.py's exact checkpointed/rotating-index mechanism wholesale
(deadline/on_checkpoint in fetch_listings(), GRID_STATE_FILE persisting
which OBLAST_SLUGS index to resume from next run so a bounded run's
leftover oblasts rotate to the front next time instead of the same tail
being starved forever) - adding a full second, oblast-scale crawl on top
of an already-timeout-respecting city crawl is exactly the shape item 30
already fixed for olx.bg, so this does not reinvent that mechanism.
Overlap between CITY_SLUGS and OBLAST_SLUGS (e.g. Sofia listings returned
by both "grad-sofiya" and "oblast-sofiya") is deduped the same way both
scrapers already dedup everything else: by listing id, via the single
`seen` dict shared across both phases within a run.

imot.bg genuinely carries no coordinates anywhere in its own pages -
confirmed by a real headless browser (cookie consent handled, WebGL
software rendering enabled, navigator.webdriver patched away) finding no
map DOM node, no live google.maps.Map object, and no maps iframe on a
real listing, plus a plain static-HTML fetch turning up nothing either.
So each listing's real area name is geocoded via OpenStreetMap Nominatim
(geo_utils.Geocoder) - but at nationwide scale, doing that live and inline
during the scrape doesn't fit in a single run (the same problem
scraper_homes.py hit first - see its module docstring), so this only does
a cache-only lookup and leaves the rest for backfill_geocode_imot.py to
fill in as a separate, decoupled pass. This portal's search also isn't
apartments-only (it's "all sales" per query), so each listing's category is
classified from its title too, for the frontend's same-category
radius-average feature.
