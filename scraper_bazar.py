"""
Scrapes current apartment-for-sale listings from bazar.bg, nationwide.

bazar.bg is a general classifieds site (cars, jobs, real estate, etc), so
this scopes to its own "apartments for sale" category URL per city
(https://bazar.bg/obiavi/prodazhba-apartamenti/<city>) rather than a
sitewide search - the site itself filters out unrelated categories.
Confirmed by sampling 68 live listings during development: 100% were
genuine apartment-for-sale titles ("Продава <N>-СТАЕН, гр. <City>, <area>"
or "Продава МЕЗОНЕТ/МНОГОСТАЕН, гр. <City>, <area>"), none from other
categories. bazar.bg has no bot-blocking - plain requests work fine.

Each listing card is the smallest ancestor whose text mentions the price
("<amount> €") exactly once, same "climb from the link" approach as
scraper.py, scraper_alo.py, scraper_imot.py, and scraper_olx.py. Within
that card the price amount and the "€" sign are on separate lines, so the
price is read by finding the "€" line and taking the digits from the line
right before it. bazar.bg's listing grid doesn't show square meters (only
the individual listing page does), so sqm/price_per_sqm are left null here
- the same graceful degradation compute_leads() already applies to any
listing missing sqm.

Nationwide mechanism: bazar.bg supports BOTH a bare "drop the city
segment" nationwide URL AND per-city path segments (unlike imot.bg/
imoti.net, which need per-city slugs exclusively) - but live pagination
testing found the site clamps out-of-range page numbers to its real last
page and repeats it verbatim, rather than ever showing an empty page
(confirmed: page 30's and page 50's listing ID sets were byte-identical).
That means the old "stop on empty page" logic never actually fires past
the real depth - it would silently loop through every remaining page
re-fetching the same content. Real content on a single query stops
changing around page 26, so CITY_SLUGS (each a live-verified
/obiavi/prodazhba-apartamenti/<slug> URL) slices by city instead, and
pagination now stops as soon as a page's listing ID set exactly matches
the previous page's (the real plateau signal), not just on an empty page
- confirmed live that a different city query still gets fresh content in
the same session after a previous city has already plateaued.

docs/backlog.md item 31 - oblast-level slicing investigated, NOT usable
for this portal the way it is for scraper_olx.py's OBLAST_SLUGS: this
sandbox has no live network access to bazar.bg at all (a direct HTTPS
fetch and a WebFetch call both came back blocked by this session's
egress policy - the same class of restriction earlier sessions already
hit against cdnjs/jsdelivr/Supabase, see docs/decisions.md), so the
"live network access, not guessed" bar this item calls for was met
through Google's live index of real bazar.bg pages instead (real URLs,
real titles, real listing counts - an external signal, not a guess, just
not a direct fetch). That research found bazar.bg DOES have real
oblast-level pages - but only as sitewide, all-category "browse" pages
under /obiavi/oblast-<slug> (e.g. oblast-plovdiv, oblast-varna) or
/obiavi/<slug>-oblast for a couple of oblasts (sofia-oblast, smolian-
oblast) - never nested under /obiavi/prodazhba-apartamenti/, and no
evidence either combination (e.g. prodazhba-apartamenti/sofia-oblast)
resolves. Routing this scraper through that sitewide page instead would
mean cars/jobs/electronics/furniture - also commonly priced in "<N> €" -
start passing this file's own "smallest ancestor with exactly one price
mention" card filter, and geo_utils.classify_category() is explicitly
documented (see its own docstring, and the real sales.bcpea.org bug it
describes) as unreliable off an apartments-only scope: it defaults any
unmatched title to "apartment", so a car or job listing from a sitewide
feed would silently get mislabeled and counted as a real apartment lead
instead of being dropped. That's a correctness regression, not a
coverage win, so it was rejected.

What the same research DID confirm live (via distinct, separately-
indexed bazar.bg pages, each with its own real listing count) is that
/obiavi/prodazhba-apartamenti/<slug> is granular well below city level -
small towns and even resort villages already have their own real page.
CITY_SLUGS below adds 8 such settlements a plain 29-big-city list
structurally can never include: 2 oblast capitals missing from both this
list and scraper_olx.py's own OBLAST_SLUGS (Разград, Смолян), 2 of the
exact small/mid towns docs/backlog.md item 31's own spot-check named as
missing (Петрич, Троян), and 4 more real, populated settlements (Банско,
Свети Влас, Обзор, Велинград). This is the "another defined, principled
method... e.g. oblast capitals plus the existing city list" fallback
item 31's own text pre-authorizes when true oblast-level querying isn't
available for a given portal - a real, evidence-based widening, not a
full nationwide fix. Bulgaria's remaining ~5,000 villages and the rest of
its ~230 smaller towns are still not covered; closing that gap for real
would need either a live-confirmed oblast+apartments-category combo URL
(unconfirmed either way here) or a much larger settlement list, verified
live by a session that actually has network access to bazar.bg - flagged
here rather than guessed at.

Each listing's city/area used to be tagged directly from which CITY_SLUGS
entry produced it (known from the URL, not parsed from text). Now parsed
from the card's own "гр. <City>, <area>" line instead (CITY_AREA_LINE_RE)
- the same "trust the listing's own text, not the query" reasoning
scraper_olx.py already uses for its oblast queries, applied here too so a
future settlement addition that leaks a neighboring town's listings (the
same "incidental leakage" the old docstring already flagged for Cherven
Bryag) gets tagged correctly instead of inheriting the query slug's
display name. VILLAGE_LINE_RE mirrors scraper_olx.py's own "с. <Village>"
fallback for a village-formatted card; unlike CITY_AREA_LINE_RE's "гр."
form (live-verified against real Plovdiv/Varna/Burgas card text), this
form was never directly observed on bazar.bg in this session - harmless
if it never matches, since a card matching neither line format still
falls back to the query's own display name exactly as before.

Search results are paginated with ?page=N. A page fetch retries a few
times with backoff before being treated as the end of pagination (same
pattern as scraper.py/scraper_alo.py), so a transient failure doesn't get
mistaken for having reached the last page - and, since scrape.yml runs
several scrapers sequentially with a single git commit step at the end,
an uncaught exception here would otherwise silently discard every other
scraper's output for that run too.

fetch_listings() now takes deadline/on_checkpoint and persists which
CITY_SLUGS index to resume from next run in GRID_STATE_FILE - the exact
checkpointed/rotating mechanism docs/backlog.md item 30 shipped for
scraper_olx.py's own oblast loop (see that file's fetch_listings()/
main()/load_grid_state()/save_grid_state() - ported here near verbatim,
adjusted only for this file having no browser/geocoder to manage), built
in from the start rather than bolted on after growing CITY_SLUGS from 29
to 37 entries made a monolithic, unbounded loop genuinely more likely to
run long. main()'s record_new()/checkpoint closure dedups by listing id
(recorded_ids) the same way, so a run that checkpoints after several
completed settlements - each checkpoint carrying the FULL accumulated
listings so far, not just that settlement's own delta - doesn't
double-append a history snapshot for a listing that shows up in more
than one checkpoint within the same run. Unlike scraper_olx.py, no
separate oblast-level query runs alongside CITY_SLUGS here (rejected
above), so there is no cross-query overlap (e.g. Sofia via both an
oblast query and its own city query) to dedup against - all_listings
being keyed by listing id is still kept as the general-purpose safety
net it already was.

Real coordinates live only on each listing's own detail page, as
data-lat/data-long attributes on its #see_on_map element (confirmed live
via a plain, non-JS HTTP fetch - no headless browser needed). At
nationwide scale, visiting every tracked listing's own page during the
main scrape doesn't fit in a single run (the same problem
scraper_homes.py hit first - see its module docstring), so this no longer
does that inline - backfill_detail_bazar.py does it as a separate,
decoupled pass. A detail-page fetch that fails there just leaves that one
listing without coordinates for that run rather than aborting the whole
backfill.
