"""
Fills in description for olx.bg listings that scraper_olx.py's grid crawl
never visits the detail page for.

olx.bg's own search-result cards carry no free-text description at all
(only price/area/sqm/update-date) - the real, seller-written description
sits on each listing's own detail page, as the "description" key of a
<script type="application/ld+json"> block. Confirmed live via
probe_descriptions.py: a plain requests.get() gets blocked outright
(403, same Akamai-style edge check scraper_olx.py's own grid crawl
already works around with Playwright), but a normal Playwright/Chromium
visit - no stealth tricks needed - gets through and returns the real,
full description.

This script is a new, separate, resumable pass - olx.bg's grid crawl has
never visited individual detail pages at all - visiting each listing's own
page (scraper_olx.py's fetch_listing_detail(), a lighter-weight sibling of
the grid crawl's own fetch_html() that skips the lazy-load scroll loop,
which only matters on a search-results page) for whatever hasn't been
checked yet, prioritized newest-first (by first_seen) so freshly
discovered listings get a real description before older ones queue behind
them - same pattern backfill_detail_alo.py/backfill_detail_bazar.py/
backfill_detail_bcpea.py/backfill_detail_imot.py already established.

A listing is marked "detail_checked" once its detail page has actually
been visited, regardless of whether that page turned up a real
description - without an explicit marker those would get needlessly
re-visited by every future run instead of being treated as done.

Scheduled hourly (see backfill-detail-olx.yml) - a fresh full backlog
clears over a few days at this run's cap, after which each run only has
to keep up with that day's newly-discovered listings, a much smaller
number.
