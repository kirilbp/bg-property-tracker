"""
One-time correction pass: geocodes every listing that currently falls into
the site's "Others" province bucket (no known oblast) across the 6 portals
whose own scraped text already names a real settlement/area - just not one
this project happened to already recognize (see sync_to_supabase.py's
BG_MUNICIPALITY_TO_OBLAST docstring for the bulk of that story).

Deliberately reuses geo_utils.Geocoder unchanged - the same confidence-
gated bare-name cross-check built earlier this project specifically so a
genuinely ambiguous settlement name (a real, different place sharing the
same name elsewhere in Bulgaria - "Бяла" is the clearest known example,
a real municipality in both Varna and Ruse oblasts) gets correctly SKIPPED
here rather than guessed at, the same way it protects the live scrapers'
own geocoding. This script does not lower that bar - if a name can't be
resolved confidently, it stays in "Others" rather than being force-fit
into the wrong province, on the same principle that caused real damage
earlier in this project when it was violated (see
verify_geocode_qualifiers.py's own docstring).

Once a listing has real lat/lng, sync_to_supabase.py's own
oblast_key_from_latlng() (point-in-polygon against real oblast boundaries)
resolves its province correctly on the next sync - no new classification
code needed here, just getting coordinates onto these specific listings
now instead of waiting for each portal's own generic, non-targeted
geocode/detail backfill to eventually reach them by chance.

alo.bg is NOT covered here - its "Others" listings carry no usable text
at all (city=None, area="Bulgaria", a scraper-side parsing gap on cards
this shape doesn't match) - see backfill_others_alo_detail.py, which
visits each one's own detail page instead (the only real signal alo.bg
has for these).

Not scheduled - a one-time correction, run by hand once, its job done.
