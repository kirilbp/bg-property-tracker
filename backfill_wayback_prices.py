"""
One-time backfill: injects real pre-tracking price history for imot.bg and
bazar.bg listings, sourced from the Wayback Machine's archived captures of
each portal's Sofia search page.

Why this works when nothing else did: individual listing pages are almost
never archived (~2.5% coverage, see the removed wayback_probe.py), but
search/category pages are crawled far more often since they're linked-to
and indexed. probe_wayback_category.py confirmed this empirically: imot.bg's
search page has 18 real captures (Apr 2025 - Jul 2026), and a meaningful
fraction of the listing IDs on those old archived pages are STILL present
in our currently-tracked data - the most recent capture alone overlapped
35% of a 40-listing sample. That overlap is exactly what makes this useful:
for those specific listings, the Wayback Machine saw a real price before we
ever did.

This fetches every real capture of each search page (not a sample), parses
listing cards using the same technique as the live scrapers
(scraper_imot.py / scraper_bazar.py), and for every listing that's both
(a) currently in our tracked history and (b) was captured at a timestamp
earlier than our own first_seen for it, inserts that as a real historical
snapshot - never touching or reordering anything we observed ourselves.
Each injected snapshot is tagged "source": "wayback" so it stays
distinguishable from our own live observations (compute_leads() ignores
unknown keys, so this doesn't change how price_history gets derived - a
genuine price difference between the Wayback snapshot and whatever we
first recorded shows up as a real point on the chart, honestly sourced).

Only run once per portal's available captures - Wayback doesn't crawl more
often by re-running this, so there's nothing to gain from scheduling it.
