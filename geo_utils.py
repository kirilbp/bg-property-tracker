"""
Shared helpers for the radius-average feature: property-category
classification and OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoding.

Category classification is a Bulgarian-keyword match against a listing's
title. Most portals already scope their search URL to apartments only
(alo.bg, homes.bg, imoti.bg), but imot.bg and olx.bg search "all real
estate for sale" and genuinely mix in houses/land/commercial - so every
portal runs the same classifier for consistency, rather than trusting
"apartments-only" portals to never contain a mislabeled listing.

Geocoding covers the 4 portals with no coordinates anywhere in their own
pages (static or JS-rendered) - homes.bg, olx.bg, imot.bg, imoti.bg,
confirmed by direct investigation (static HTML regex scan + a real headless
browser with cookie handling, WebGL enabled, and navigator.webdriver
patched, still found no map DOM node, no live google.maps.Map object, and
no maps iframe on either imot.bg or imoti.bg). Each of those 4 portals'
search is scoped to Sofia, and every listing carries a real neighborhood
name (the existing "area" field) - not a per-listing address, but real and
geocodable at neighborhood precision via OpenStreetMap's free Nominatim
API. Nominatim's usage policy caps free use at ~1 request/second and
expects heavy users to cache rather than re-request - and since Sofia has
only a few hundred distinct neighborhood names total (reused across
thousands of listings), caching by the query string itself (not per
listing) turns this into a one-time fixed cost rather than one geocode
call per listing: after the first run populates data/geocode_cache.json,
essentially every later call is a cache hit and costs nothing.

imoti.net, alo.bg, and bazar.bg need no geocoding at all - each embeds
real, listing-exact coordinates directly in its own listing page's HTML
(confirmed live): imoti.net as literal "latitude"/"longitude" JSON keys,
alo.bg as a plain <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=LAT,LNG"> share
link, and bazar.bg as data-lat/data-long attributes on its #see_on_map
element - all present in the plain server-rendered HTML with no
JavaScript execution required, so a normal requests.get() picks them up.

# NOTE (backlog #9, 2026-09-23): `.obqva-block` was previously believed to

# sampling 200 real non-empty descriptions from data/leads_alo.json found
# 165/200 (82.5%) are literal substrings of that same listing's own `title`
# field - e.g. title "...Двустаен апартамент в к-с Суит хоум 2 Слънчев
# бряг, област Бургас" -> stored description "Двустаен апартамент в к-с
# Суит хоум 2". Re-sampling 300 records independently while fixing this
# reproduced the same shape at an even higher rate (265/300 = 88.3% exact
# substrings; nearly all of the remainder are still obvious near-duplicate
# title fragments, e.g. differing only by a trailing "!" or an emoji the
# title-truncation display cut off), never real seller-written prose. This
# is the same bug class as the already-fixed homes.bg case just above
# `extract_description_ldjson()`'s definition (see scraper_homes.py): a
# field that looks like a real description but is actually an echo of the
# title/heading blurb next to it.
#
# `.obqva-block` was very likely the wrong element - probably a heading/
# summary blurb rendered near the title (the site may reuse that CSS class
# for more than one unrelated box), not alo.bg's actual ad body. This
# couldn't be confirmed live at the time (alo.bg is blocked from this
# sandbox's network egress - both a plain HTTPS request and the WebFetch
# tool return a hard EGRESS_BLOCKED/403 for www.alo.bg), so a class-name
# fix was deferred pending live access and this function returned None
# unconditionally in the meantime (a title-echo is actively misleading - it
# looks like a real description, so a reader trusts it as one - so "no
# description available" was strictly better than a fake one).
#
# UPDATE (2026-09-24): network access is still blocked, but the user
# supplied real screenshots of a live detail page (alo_11319466,
# https://www.alo.bg/prodavam-atelie-v-zona-b-19-11319466). They show the
# real free-text ad body sitting under a fixed Bulgarian heading,
# "Допълнителна информация" ("Additional information") - a separate,
# clearly-labeled section, not the title/heading blurb `.obqva-block` was
# apparently grabbing. Rather than guess a new CSS class (unverifiable
# without live HTML, and exactly the mistake that caused the original bug),
# this targets the fixed heading TEXT instead: find the "Допълнителна
# информация" label wherever it sits in the DOM, then walk up from it
# looking for the first ancestor whose own text - once the heading itself
# is stripped off the front - is long enough to plausibly be real prose
# (see MIN_ALO_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH below). This is deliberately structure-
# agnostic: it works whether the heading and body are two sibling elements,
# or share one common wrapper (like `.obqva-block` might have), since
# either shape still has *some* ancestor of the heading whose text also
# contains the body. If the site's markup doesn't match this shape at all
# (heading missing, or every ancestor's text is still just the heading
# plus noise), this returns None rather than guess - never re-introduces
# the title-echo bug by falling back to some other unrelated element.

# agency contact (agency_name/agency_website - see extract_contact_alo()),
# and coordinates. This sandbox's network egress to olx.bg is blocked (same

# via WebFetch while doing this work) and no raw olx.bg detail-page HTML is
# saved anywhere in this repo (no probe_*.py output, no test fixture) to
# inspect instead, so none of that could be verified - and, unlike
# "description"/"image" (obviously listing-specific, only one plausible
# meaning), none of the remaining fields have a genuinely safe bet:
#   - Bulgarian-specific specs (property type, construction type, floor,
#     elevator/furnished/heating) have no standard Schema.org property at
#     all - representing them would need guessing site-specific
#     "additionalProperty" label strings with zero evidence any exist,
#     exactly the kind of fabricated selector this project's standing rule
#     (see extract_contact_alo()'s own comment on why phone numbers are
#     never guessed) forbids.
#   - Coordinates are NOT a "couldn't check" gap - this file's own module
#     docstring above already documents a direct prior investigation
#     (static HTML regex scan + a real headless browser checking for a map
#     DOM node/live google.maps object/iframe) that found olx.bg carries no
#     coordinates anywhere on its own pages at all, which is exactly why
#     Geocoder/Nominatim exists for this portal in the first place. Adding
#     a speculative geo/latitude/longitude ld+json reader here would
#     contradict that confirmed finding, not extend it.
#   - seller/author (for agency_name/agency_website) IS plausible in
#     principle, but genuinely ambiguous in a way "image" wasn't: Schema.org
#     "author"/top-level "seller" on a listing can just as easily name the
#     PUBLISHER (OLX Group / olx.bg itself) as the actual poster, and
#     getting that wrong wouldn't fail harmlessly the way an absent "image"
#     key would - it would silently write a wrong, misleading "agency" onto
#     real listings at nationwide scale. Not implemented without a real
#     sample to check which one it actually is.
#
# floorSize is the one field kept: a genuinely unambiguous, single-meaning
# standard Schema.org property (a QuantitativeValue holding the listing's
# own floor area) - same "worth trying, one more optional key on the same
# already-proven-real blob, degrades to None with zero downside if absent"
# reasoning extract_photos_ldjson() itself was written on above, before its

# version of this comment, was never actually committed to this repo - no
# probe output, workflow, or captured HTML fixture survives anywhere in git
# history or in tests/ - so its "14 anchors" claim could not be
# independently re-verified this session).
#
# 2026-09-24 fix (see docs/missy-findings and this change's own commit for
# the investigation): a production sample of 29,792 real, independently-
# varied alo.bg listings that the CURRENT extractor has actually run
# against - i.e. every listing marked `_photos_checked: True` - had a 0.0%
# photos hit rate. That is not plausible as "alo.bg listings genuinely never
# have a gallery"; real-estate listings on a major portal virtually always
# carry more than one photo, and this project's OWN grid-crawl already
# proves single cover photos are routinely present (see `photo` in
# fetch_listings_page()). The root cause: the regex below required the
# anchor's `class`, `data-type`, and `href` attributes to appear in that
# EXACT order, with double quotes specifically, inside the same `<a ...>`
# tag - real HTML attribute order/quoting is not guaranteed to match
# whatever order was hand-transcribed into a regex, and unlike every other
# extractor in this file (extract_description_alo/extract_specs_alo/
# extract_contact_alo, all BeautifulSoup-based), this was the only one that
# parsed raw HTML text as a fixed-order string pattern instead of an actual
# parsed DOM - and it also shipped with zero test coverage (unlike its three
# siblings in tests/test_alo_detail_extraction.py), so this brittleness was
# never caught. Rewritten below to look up the anchor via BeautifulSoup
# instead - order/quote-independent by construction, exactly like every
# other alo.bg extractor already is. This still requires the same two
# identifying signals (a `fancyimages` class token AND `data-type="image"`)
# with no loosening of what counts as a gallery photo, only of the
# structural assumption (attribute order) that was demonstrably too narrow.
#
# One extra non-photo anchor with data-type="ajax" (a "more on Google"
# panel, per the original comment) is still excluded by requiring
# data-type="image".

# alo.bg's structured spec table (confirmed via real user-supplied

# alo()'s own comment for why: this sandbox's network egress to alo.bg is
# blocked, so this is built from a real rendered page image, not a live
# HTML probe) is a fixed sequence of Bulgarian label/value rows:
# Местоположение (location - not extracted here, already covered by area/
# city/lat/lng elsewhere), Вид на имота (property type), Квадратура
# (size), Вид строителство (construction type - no "на", confirmed against
# the real screenshot and corroborated by the same phrasing already seen in
# scraped bazar.bg/olx.bg description text elsewhere in this codebase),
# Година на строителство
# (built year), Степен на завършеност (completion status), Номер на етажа
# (floor number), Етаж (floor qualifier - e.g. "Непоследен"/"Последен"/
# "Партер"), and Особености (feature checkboxes - the screenshot shows
# only the CHECKED features rendered as visible tags at all, e.g.
# "Асансьор"/"Необзаведен"/"ТЕЦ" - no visible "unchecked" state to parse).
#
# Same reasoning as extract_description_alo(): rather than guess this
# table's CSS classes/tag names (unverifiable without live HTML, and
# exactly the mistake that produced the `.obqva-block` bug), this locates
# each row by its fixed Bulgarian LABEL text and reads whatever text
# follows it, using BeautifulSoup's get_text("\n", strip=True) to flatten
# the page into one line per underlying text node. That works regardless
# of whether a row is a <tr><td> pair, a <dl><dt>/<dd> pair, or a pair of
# <div>s - in every one of those shapes the label and its value are still
# two separate text nodes next to each other. A value spanning more than
# one text node (e.g. "1980 г." plus a separate, dimmer "(годината може да
# е ориентировъчна)" hint span - both visible in the screenshot as one
# line of rendered text) is handled by joining lines until the next known
# label or a stop marker is reached, not just taking a single next line.
#
# Defensive by construction: a row whose label isn't found is simply
# absent from the result (never guessed), and if NO known label is found
# at all this returns None outright - a structural page change should
# shrink what gets extracted, never produce garbage under a
# plausible-looking key.
#
# 2026-09-24 investigation (see this change's own commit): production data
# shows only 3.9% of the 29,792 listings the current extractor has actually
# run against have any spec populated at all - much lower than a real
# structured spec table plausibly explains on its own (this project has no
# live evidence either way - the screenshot this was built from can't show
# what fraction of real listings fill in the table). One assumption in the
# label-matching below WAS provably too narrow regardless of that base
# rate, and is fixed here: `line == label` requires the label to be its own
# ENTIRE, isolated text node before it'll even look for a value - a
# screenshot can show "Label: Value" rendered as one visual row but cannot
# show whether that row is really two separate DOM text nodes (what every
# test fixture here assumed, since that's the only shape anyone could
# write a fixture for) or one flattened "Label: Value" text node (get_text
# would then produce a single line, e.g. "Вид на имота: Тристаен
# апартамент", which the old exact-equality check could never match at
# all). _alo_label_match() below now also accepts that second shape -
# still gated on the literal Bulgarian label text, never guessed, just no

# alo.bg's "Контакт с подателя на обявата" ("Contact the poster") box
# (confirmed via the same real screenshots as extract_description_alo() -
# see that function's comment for the network-access caveat) shows the
# poster's display name/agency name as plain text, followed by one or more
# links: an alo.bg-hosted storefront page for that poster (e.g.
# "endrevahouses.alo.bg") and, separately, the agency's own real external
# website (e.g. "https://endreva-houses.com"). Only the real external site
# is extracted as agency_website - the alo.bg-hosted one is just an
# internal profile page on this same portal, not independently useful
# contact info.
#
# The box also shows a partially-masked phone number ("08X XXX XXXX")
# behind a green "Виж" ("View") button. This is DELIBERATELY NOT extracted
# here. The masked format plus a click-to-reveal button is the standard
# shape of a JS/AJAX-revealed number - the real digits are normally
# fetched from the server only once the button is actually clicked,
# specifically so a plain page fetch can't harvest them (a common anti-
# scraping/lead-tracking pattern on Bulgarian classifieds sites) - rather
# than a value merely hidden by CSS while already sitting in the raw
# HTML/DOM. This project's network access to alo.bg is blocked in this
# sandbox (see extract_description_alo()'s own comment), so which of those
# two this actually is could not be confirmed by inspecting a real masked
# page's raw HTML. Per this project's own standing rule - never fabricate
# a working extraction for something that can't be verified - no phone
# extraction is implemented here rather than guess one that might return
# nothing (or garbage) against the real page. If a future contributor gets
# live access, the concrete thing to check is whether the full number (or
# a `data-phone`/similar attribute holding it) is already present
# somewhere in the raw HTML/a same-page <script> block for a masked
# listing; if so, add a real extractor. If the number is genuinely only
# returned by a follow-up XHR after the click, it can't be obtained from a
# plain page fetch at all, and this gap is a portal limitation, not a

# 2026-09-25 after a production audit found property_type_raw/agency_name/
# agency_website at a flat 0% (0/912) despite every listing having gone
# through fetch_listing_detail(). The comment this replaced claimed
# fetch_listing_detail() "already has PROVEN, live-confirmed access to this
# page's own <script type="application/ld+json"> block(s) - that's exactly
# how its description extraction already works." That claim does not
# actually hold up: fetch_listing_detail() tries a <meta name="description">
# (or og:description) tag FIRST, and only falls back to scanning ld+json for
# a "description" field when that meta tag is missing/too short - see its
# own code in scraper_imoti_bg.py. Production's 94%+ description hit rate is
# perfectly explained by the meta-tag path alone (present on essentially
# every generic webpage) and is not evidence the ld+json fallback, let alone
# ld+json parsing in general, has EVER actually succeeded on a real imoti.bg
# page. This was the same shape of mistake as alo.bg's own regression
# (PR #279): a confident "this is already proven" claim that wasn't actually
# checked against what really drives the number it points to.
#
# Two real, independent failure modes could produce exactly this 0% pattern,
# and this sandbox's network egress to imoti.bg is blocked (confirmed again
# this session, same as every other scraper's own egress-block note), so
# live re-verification wasn't possible and CLAUDE.md rules out finding out
# via a live workflow_dispatch:
#   1. imoti.bg's real ld+json (if it carries any at all) simply doesn't use
#      the RealEstateListing/Accommodation/Organization schema.org shape
#      assumed below - genuinely unverifiable without live access.
#   2. A common, well-documented real-world JSON-LD quirk: many sites
#      generate a script's JSON text from a raw user-submitted description
#      containing literal newline/control characters without escaping them,
#      which trips Python's DEFAULT strict `json.loads()` (control characters
#      are illegal inside a JSON string under strict mode) - silently
#      swallowed here by the bare `except (ValueError, TypeError): continue`,
#      exactly like it would be in fetch_listing_detail()'s own ld+json
#      fallback for description. This is not a guess about imoti.bg's
#      specific markup - it's a generic, well-known parser fragility this
#      code can safely harden against regardless of which (if either) cause
#      is the real one, so _imoti_bg_ld_json_candidates() below now retries
#      with `strict=False` before giving up on a block. It also now tracks
#      basic counts so a future run's logs (scraper_imoti_bg.py's own
#      diagnostic print, gated on real access to production) can tell these
#      two failure modes apart for real instead of guessing further here.

# What's extracted below is deliberately limited to CORE schema.org
# vocabulary terms with a fixed, documented meaning - not a guess about this
# specific site's markup:
#   - floorSize (a standard Accommodation/Place property, {"@type":
#     "QuantitativeValue", "value": ...}) -> sqm.
#   - amenityFeature (a standard Accommodation property, an array of
#     {"@type": "LocationFeatureSpecification", "name": ..., "value": true}
#     entries) -> features[]/has_elevator/furnished/has_central_heating,
#     using the same keyword-match approach extract_specs_alo() already
#     uses for its own (differently-sourced) feature tags.
#   - @type itself, when it's one of schema.org's own named Accommodation
#     subtypes (Apartment/House/SingleFamilyResidence/Room/Suite/...) ->
#     property_type_raw. This is the type schema.org itself defines for
#     "what kind of accommodation this is" - not a fabricated field.
#   - seller/offers.seller/provider/author (a standard Organization/Person
#     shape with "name" and, optionally, "url") -> agency_name/
#     agency_website, mirroring extract_contact_alo()'s exact same "only a
#     genuine external site, never the portal's own domain" restraint.
#
# What's deliberately NOT attempted here, for lack of any real evidence:
# construction_type, built_year, completion_status, floor_number, and
# floor_qualifier - schema.org has no core vocabulary term for any of
# these (unlike floorSize/amenityFeature/the Accommodation subtypes above,
# which are real, documented schema.org properties), so filling them in
# would mean guessing this specific site's own custom field/label names
# sight-unseen - exactly the "never fabricate a working extraction for
# something that can't be verified" mistake extract_contact_alo()'s own
# comment (phone numbers) already warns against. If a future contributor
# gets live access to a real imoti.bg detail page, the concrete thing to
# check is what (if anything) is in a candidate's "additionalProperty"
# array (schema.org's generic name/value escape hatch for exactly this
# kind of site-specific extra fact) - if these fields are there under some
# real, observed name, add a real extractor for them then.

# neighboring comment) is a fixed sequence of Bulgarian label/value rows:
# Тип сделка (a combined transaction+property-type sentence, e.g. "Продава
# Апартамент в гр. София" - not extracted here, too generic to be useful
# and superseded by Тип апартамент below), Тип апартамент (the specific
# room-count property type, e.g. "2-стаен" - the actually useful value,
# stored as property_type_raw), Квадратура (size, e.g. "50 кв. м."), Цена
# на кв.м. (price per sqm, e.g. "2240 €/кв. м." - not extracted; this
# project already computes price_per_sqm downstream from price/sqm
# elsewhere, no need to also trust the portal's own pre-computed figure),
# Вид строителство (construction type, e.g. "ЕПК" - no "на", same
# phrasing already confirmed for alo.bg's own row of the same name), and
# Етаж (a bare floor NUMBER on bazar.bg, e.g. "4" - unlike alo.bg, where
# "Етаж" is a floor QUALIFIER like "Непоследен" and the number lives under
# a separate "Номер на етажа" row; bazar.bg's own screenshot shows no
# qualifier row at all, so this maps straight to floor_number).
#
# Same reasoning as extract_specs_alo() (see its own comment): rather than
# guess this table's CSS classes/tag names, this locates each row by its
# fixed Bulgarian LABEL text and reads whatever text follows it, using
# BeautifulSoup's get_text("\n", strip=True) to flatten the page into one
# line per underlying text node - works regardless of whether a row is a
# <tr><td> pair, a <dl><dt>/<dd> pair, or a pair of <div>s. Every real
# value in the screenshot is a single short line (unlike alo.bg's built_
# year row, which had a separate trailing hint span), so the per-row value
# cap here is deliberately tighter (2 lines, not alo's 4) - just enough
# margin for a value split across two text nodes without risking Етаж (the
# last known row, with no confirmed heading/stop-text right after it on
# this portal) pulling a chunk of the free-text description paragraph
# underneath it into its own value. floor_number is still safe even if
# that happens: it's read out with a digit-only regex search that matches
# the FIRST number in the collected text, which is always the real "4"
# itself (collected before any description text could be appended), never
# a number appearing later in that description.
#
# Defensive by construction, same as every other extractor in this file:
# a row whose label isn't found is simply absent from the result, and if
# NO known label is found at all this returns None outright.

# --- Compressed on-disk JSON storage --------------------------------------
# 2026-09-25 addendum to this same incident (see STALE_RECORD_RETENTION's
# own comment just below): evict_stale_records() alone was found NOT to
# unblock the very next scrape.yml run. Root cause (found by reading git
# history, not guessed): dd83178 (2026-09-23, "Fix homes.bg tracking-ID
# type collision") fixed build_tracking_id() to stop dropping homes.bg's
# hs/as/lp/la type prefix - before that fix, listings of DIFFERENT types
# sharing the same bare numeric id silently collided onto one tracking key
# and overwrote each other on alternating scrapes, so many real, distinct
# listings were invisibly suppressed for a long time (only one "side" of
# each collision ever visible at a time). Once fixed, every collision
# pair's previously-hidden "other side" starts appearing as a genuinely
# new record the next time it's freshly scraped - a real, wanted, one-time
# correction (not a bug in dd83178, not stale data), but it means
# evict_stale_records() evicting 0 records today is not "nothing to fix
# yet": the very next real crawl was confirmed (real job-log output:
# check_scrape_freshness.py's own leads count) to produce 140,337 total
# homes.bg leads, ~1.90x today's committed 74,012 - large enough on its
# own to blow through the 100MB limit again immediately, independent of
# long-term eviction.
#
# What was checked and rejected first: capping the `photos` array (41.6%
# of leads_homes.json's bytes, field-by-field measured) looked like the
# obvious lever, but sync_to_supabase.py's SOURCE_FIELDS/MERGED_FIELDS
# copies the FULL `photos` list straight from leads_homes.json into
# Supabase's listing_sources/merged_listings columns, and index.html's own
# detail-page gallery (`sourcePhotos`/`mergedPhotos` in its `showDetail()`
# path) renders every one of them - not dead weight checked only for
# truthiness/count, a real, live call site. Real measurement against
# homes.bg's actual 74,012-record leads_homes.json: even capping every
# record to a single photo (a severe, real functional loss - no more
# multi-photo gallery for 45-66% of listings depending on the cap chosen)
# combined with compact (no-indent) serialization only reaches ~111.7MB
# projected at 140,337 records - STILL over the 100MB limit, for a real
# product regression bought and not even enough on its own.
#
# Gzip compression, by contrast, recovers far more with ZERO data loss
# (full round-trip fidelity - every photo, every field, byte-identical
# after decompression) because these files are enormously repetitive:
# the same ~30 JSON keys and shared URL domains/path prefixes repeated
# across tens of thousands of near-identical records is exactly what
# gzip is built for. Measured directly on real homes.bg data: leads_
# homes.json, 74,012 records, 79.48MB compact-serialized -> 6.41MB
# gzipped (level 9, ~91.9% smaller); history_homes.json: 73.97MB compact
# -> 6.08MB gzipped. Projected at the real 140,337-record scale (linear
# scaling validated against scrape.yml's own real quoted incident numbers
# - 182.01MB/179.26MB pretty-printed at that same scale, matching this
# module's projection from the 74,012-record baseline to within ~1.5%):
# ~11.6MB (leads) / ~11.0MB (history) - roughly 8.5x headroom under
# GitHub's 100MB hard limit, not a razor's-edge fix that recurs the next
# time record count ticks up again.
#
# load_json_any()/save_json_any() below are the single read/write path
# every history_*.json/leads_*.json consumer (every scraper, sync_to_
# supabase.py, evict_stale_history.py, detect_relistings.py, verify_
# geocode_qualifiers.py, check_scrape_freshness.py, backfill_split_homes_
# id_collision.py) goes through, so a portal's on-disk format (plain vs.
# gzip) is a pure file-extension choice at that portal's own HISTORY_FILE/
# LEADS_FILE/PORTAL_FILES constant, not something every call site has to
# special-case. Only homes.bg's own HISTORY_FILE/LEADS_FILE were switched
# to `.json.gz` here - this incident is homes.bg-specific (dd83178 only

# --- Bounded history retention -------------------------------------------
# 2026-09-25 incident: scrape.yml (homes.bg/imot.bg/olx.bg/bazar.bg/
# imoti.bg/bcpea.org, committed as one atomic commit) failed its last 7
# consecutive scheduled runs on a GH001 hard file-size rejection -
# data/history_homes.json and data/leads_homes.json over GitHub's 100MB
# push limit. prune_snapshots() above already collapses each listing's
# snapshot list (that was the 2026-09-24 incident's own, different, root
# cause - a relisting-detector bug injecting synthetic snapshots into
# EXISTING records, fixed separately by RELISTING_GUARD_ABS/RATIO below).
# This incident's driver is different and structural: measured directly
# against the real committed data (homes.bg, 74,012 tracked records,
# ~94.9MB/history_homes.json, ~1282 bytes/record average, ~2.0 snapshots/
# record average post-prune) - per-record payload is roughly constant
# (dominated by the "photos" array, ~42% of leads_homes.json's bytes per a
# field-by-field measurement), so record COUNT is what actually drives
# size, and nothing has ever removed a record once its listing is
# confirmed sold/delisted: update_history() only ever adds keys via
# history[lid][...] = ..., across every one of the 8 portal scrapers.
# Two step-function events compound this: a portal's coverage widening
# from Sofia-only to nationwide/oblast-level (confirmed real - homes.bg/
# imot.bg/olx.bg's 2026-08-25 nationwide switch alone added 66,030 new
# homes.bg records in a single day per real first_seen timestamps; bazar.
# bg/imot.bg's 2026-09-23 oblast-capital coverage commits landed within
# the hour of this incident's own first failure) permanently raises the
# floor, since none of those newly-tracked listings are ever evicted once
# they eventually sell or get delisted either.
#
# Retention window (180 days) chosen from real relisting-gap data, not a
# guessed round number: detect_relistings.py's detect_portal() (matching
# a newly-active listing back to a since-removed one by photo/address) has
# no age cap on its candidate gone_ids, so an eviction window has to stay
# well clear of any real relisting delay or it starts silently breaking
# that matching. Measured every real "source": "relisted_from" pair
# already recorded across every portal's history_*.json (261 real pairs,
# all portals combined): delisted-to-relisted gap is 0.2-31.7 days, median
# 10.7, mean 12.8, 96% (250/261) within 30 days, none past 32 days - but
# this dataset has only been tracking any listings since 2026-08-21 (~35
# days as of this writing), so that 31.7-day max is itself left-censored;
# a real relisting after a longer real-world gap simply hasn't had time to
# be observed yet. 180 days gives ~5.6x headroom over the longest gap
# actually observed and leaves substantial room for longer gaps this young
# a dataset can't yet rule out, while still bounding growth to a fixed
# multiple of steady-state daily volume instead of forever. Evicted
# records are dropped outright rather than kept as a lighter-weight trace
# for relisting matching past this cutoff: the single largest per-record
# cost (the photos array, needed for exactly that matching) is what a
# "lightweight" archive would still have to keep to remain useful for it,
# so a partial archive wouldn't meaningfully help the size problem this
# exists to fix, and a relisting matched only after 180+ days off-market
# is both unobserved in this data so far and low-value to catch even when
# it happens. index.html's frontend reads Supabase, not these JSON files,
# and sync_to_supabase.py's own stale-row cleanup (MIN_PORTAL_RATIO=0.5,
# MIN_PORTAL_ABSOLUTE=10) already treats a portal's mirrored Supabase rows
# as tied to what's in the current leads_*.json, not a permanent archive -

# cutoff while simultaneously being freshly re-scraped under new listing
# IDs, and detect_relistings.py's chain logic (see its own module
# docstring) misread that as 61,862 simultaneous delisted-then-relisted
# pairs in one run - 83.6% of homes.bg's entire 74,012-listing tracked
# backlog - injecting that many synthetic snapshots and ballooning both
# files past the push limit, discarding every portal's real data on every
# failed atomic push (scrape.yml commits data/ as one commit).
#
# Calibrated from real committed history, not a guessed round number.
# **Correction (Missy's review caught this): the original version of this

# cumulative total) gives bazar.bg's real steady-state per-run injection
# rate: 6-28 relistings/run, 0.01%-0.06% of its 51,860-listing backlog -
# never close to the originally-claimed 208/0.4%. That means the real
# margin under these thresholds is far larger than first estimated
# (roughly 70-300x the busiest real per-run rate, not ~10x) - the
# threshold VALUES below don't need to change, they were already safe and
# are safer than originally believed; only this narrative was wrong. The

# scraper.py's own comments - because those tweaks are a few inline lines
# woven into each scraper's own loop). This is different: a self-contained

# listing_city_key() lives here instead of copy-pasted 8 times - one
# implementation that can't drift, not eight that could.

# rework ships) was two inputs only: min(drop_pct,0..20)/20*50 +
# min(days_on_market,0..180)/180*50. Reworked per direct user request once
# relisting detection existed to feed it: five inputs, weighted and capped
# from real distributions measured against the live committed dataset
# (all 8 portals, deduped through the same merge sync_to_supabase.py's
# group_listings() does) - not guessed. See each cap's own comment for the
# specific percentile that justified it.
#
# Matches index.html's own UNVERIFIED_PCT_THRESHOLD (computeUnverified()) -
# a price/m² this far from its area average is flagged there as a likely
# data error rather than a real bargain, and the same judgment applies
